# Meetingnotes 26.06.2018

Participants: All of us and both supervisors

## Agenda

- Sync-up: Parallelized the CPP algorithm
- Problem at the moment: Inefficient Parallelization -> Long runtime
- Current parallelization: Neighbouring sets for each tests are generated synchronously in the main thread
- Problem might be the `next_permutation` approach to generating seperation sets (is this done in the main thread?)
- Presentation: 30 minutes with questions 

## ToDo

- Optimize computation on level 1 as special case
- Metrics for our algorithm (same as in R-algorithm)
- Investigate OpenMP parallelization as to whether it actually helps on higher levels or not
  - I.e. compare their parallel algorithm with their non-parallel algorithm in terms of performance
- Profile our own algorithm
- Display measurements graphically possibly
- Decide on research and presentation contents:
  - Goal
  - Challenges
  - Current status
  - Future work until writing paper
