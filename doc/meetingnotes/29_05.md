# Meeting Notes

29.05.2018

## Feedback from presentation

### Uflacker

- Distribution only viable if there is a linear performance increase on low core counts
  - Before making the shift to distributed computing benchmark parallel PC algo on multi-core (1, 2, 4, 8, 16, etc.)
  - Only if the performance increase is almost linear, i.e.
```
  |  /
  | /
  |/___
```
- Do *Balanced Incomplete Blocks* provide improvements due to data locality during parallel PC?! (<- this will be a relatively easy core research question before distribution esp. if distribution does not make sense)

### Chris 

- On upper levels it might make a lot of sense to parallelize on the basis of tests and not on the basis of edges

### From the room
